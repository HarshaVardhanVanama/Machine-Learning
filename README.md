Machine Learning Projects

Amazon Food Reviews: Preprocessing Techniques BoW(Bag of Words), Tf-idf(Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency), W2V(Word to Vector), AvgW2V( Average Word to Vector) and TfIDf-W2V( Tf-idf weighted W2V) were applied on Amazon Food Reviews to convert the reviews to a numerical feature vectors.After this, Naive Bayes was applied on these numerical feature vectors to predict the polarity of the review.

Data Visualization: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t- distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(t-SNE) were applied on MNIST data to reduce and visualize the features.
